# Source Code Directory

Welcome to the source code directory!

This is where all the main code for your project should go. It's the root directory for your application's source code.

Organize your code in a way that's logical and easy to understand. You might want to create subdirectories for different parts of your application, like `models`, `views`, `controllers`, etc., depending on the architecture of your application.

Remember, clean and organized code is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Happy coding!
