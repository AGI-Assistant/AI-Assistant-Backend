# Tests Directory

Welcome to the tests directory!

This is where all the test code for your project should go. It's important to write tests for your code to make sure it's working as expected and to catch any bugs or issues that might come up.

You might want to mirror the structure of your `src` directory here. For example, if you have a file named `my_code.py` in the `src` directory, you could have a corresponding `test_my_code.py` file here.

Remember, good tests can make your code more robust and easier to maintain. Happy testing!
