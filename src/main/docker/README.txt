# Docker Directory

Welcome to the Docker directory!

If you're using Docker to containerize your application, this is where you would put your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file.

A Dockerfile contains the instructions for building a Docker image of your application. This image includes everything needed to run your application, such as the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to configure your application's services.

Including a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml in your repository makes it easier for others to run your application in a consistent environment. They can build the Docker image and run it on their own machine, without needing to worry about setting up the correct environment or dependencies.

Remember, the use of Docker is not mandatory, but it's a good practice for ensuring the consistency of development and production environments, especially when working in a team.
